# PETSITTING

Petsitting is a website made as a practice project. This website is originally made with bootstrap but I made it with custom CSS as a practice to brush up my CSS skills. I made couple of changes to it as well. I used SASS for writing CSS.

## Things I learned during process

1. How to use Grids effectively.
2. How to layout things with the help of Grids.
3. Making responsive menu with the help of CSS checkbox heck.
4. Using Auto-fit properties in Grids to make responsive design without media queries.
5. Approaches to solve particular problem encountered during process.
6. Level up my CSS skills.
7. How to use JavaScript to open multiple modal with lesser code.
